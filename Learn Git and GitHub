This module was useful in helpful in helping me understand Merge conflicts and how to work with them. In this project, I resolved the merge conflicts in two markdown files and because markdown is a file format that converts easily into HTML, this module better helped me understand HTML and how it connects back to markdown and how it can incorporated into what I have learned so far. I didnâ€™t have to write down any markdown, I just had to identify the differences between lines, which kept me at a good pace. I will definitely use this in the future for when I want to go over markdown again and have a better grasp of git branching and managing multiple versions of a project at once. All of this can be very useful when it comes to coordinating large project that require multiple versions or for a project that requires tracking in different parts of a project.
